Shirts
======

A solution in C++ to the BIO 2008 problem "Shirts" using a breadth-first search algorithm.

Please note:
 * The output format I have used here is not the same as specified in the question. Although this would likely lose marks, I feel it is clearer and nicer for non-competition use.
 * This is one of the first C++ programs I have written (I often use C#) and so I would like to apologise to purists of the form for any unpleasant syntax; please open an issue, as I am sure it would be useful for me to learn the correct way to do it.
 * The program is relatively well optimised, and all of the solutions specified in the mark scheme run in under 0.1s as timed by the code in the program.
